## Getting Certificates

One of the common ways professionals use to validate their knowledge is thru the presentation of certs. Just know that experience and actual projects are still better than certificates! In general Certs != Jobs okay? Letâ€™s get on by looking at the two kinds:

| **Aspect**       | **Certificate**                                                      | **Certification**                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**   | A document awarded after completing a specific course or program.    | A credential awarded after passing an exam, showing proficiency in a field. |
| **Scope**        | Focused on a specific subject or skill.                              | Covers a comprehensive range of skills or knowledge in a professional field. |
| **Duration**     | Short-term, ranging from a few hours to several months.              | Often requires ongoing education and re-certification to maintain validity. |
| **Issued By**    | Educational institutions, online platforms, or professional training bodies. | Professional organizations or certification bodies that set industry standards. |
| **Purpose**      | Educational, aimed at broadening skills and knowledge for personal or career development. | Validates professional expertise and typically required for certain jobs or career advancement. |

### Paid Certifications

## Getting Certificates

One of the common ways professionals use to validate their knowledge is thru the presentation of certs. Just know that experience and actual projects are still better than certificates! In general Certs != Jobs okay? Letâ€™s get on by looking at the two kinds:

| **Aspect**       | **Certificate**                                                      | **Certification**                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**   | A document awarded after completing a specific course or program.    | A credential awarded after passing an exam, showing proficiency in a field. |
| **Scope**        | Focused on a specific subject or skill.                              | Covers a comprehensive range of skills or knowledge in a professional field. |
| **Duration**     | Short-term, ranging from a few hours to several months.              | Often requires ongoing education and re-certification to maintain validity. |
| **Issued By**    | Educational institutions, online platforms, or professional training bodies. | Professional organizations or certification bodies that set industry standards. |
| **Purpose**      | Educational, aimed at broadening skills and knowledge for personal or career development. | Validates professional expertise and typically required for certain jobs or career advancement. |
