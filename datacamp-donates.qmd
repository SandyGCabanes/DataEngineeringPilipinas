**Q7: I really like this initiative, how do I support it?**

- A7: You can support it through the following:
  - Invite your friends that are interested in data to join our community.

  - if we send an invite and no acceptance after 2 weeks
  - if accepted but no usage after 2 weeks
  - if 4K XP monthly assignment is not completed within 4 weeks
  - the principle is, if you are using it you shouldn't worry.
